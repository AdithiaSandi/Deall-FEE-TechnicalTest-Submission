## **Requirement**

**The requirement of the web application is described as the following:**

- It needs to be built using React.js, Typescript isn’t compulsory but will be a plus point
- It has to be responsive. The layout needs to be adaptive across different devices
  It has to support pagination. The users will only be shown the page selected by them. The other pages shouldn’t be loaded if not
  necessary
- A locally-stored bookmarking feature needs to be provided so the users can pin their favourite books and browse it easily in a dedicated B
  ookmark section
- When a user is viewing the list of books of a category, a search feature is required to help him/her easily find the books based on title or
  author. There’s no Search API provided, the user is only allowed to search from the list already retrieved previously.
- The source code has to be available in github

_I'm using Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) to solve the API CORS problem._
